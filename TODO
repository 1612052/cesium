unpack the compressed bit array into u8 array? i.e. 0x1 or 0x0 at each index?
Probably since the unpacking would be in an inner loop


[ ] Try to traverse the subtree arrays in tree style (is this a waste of time?)
    Tiles store:
    NOTE: Not sure about storing subtree refs (don't store for now)
    *** should last row of availability just indicate if it has a child in those spots (to know if 0 sse or not)
    and also indicate the external availability as normal but last row can't init tiles like the rest
    of the subtree

    treeKey, subtreeKey, subtreeIndex, subtreeRootKey, subtree ref
    children treeKeys, subtreeKeys, subtreeIndices
    children subtreeRootKey, and chilren subtree ref

[ ] toroidial subtree viewer? it's camera relative, right?
[ ] look at the sse calculation and see if theres a good way to pre-calc the sse spheres and sphere deltas
[ ] incrementally move components to array style
[ ] try to go full bresenham
