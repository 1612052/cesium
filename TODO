*** should last row of availability just indicate if it has a child in those spots (to know if 0 sse or not)
and also indicate the external availability as normal but last row can't init tiles like the rest
of the subtree
*** only real reason to do the above is if 0 sse is really important and can't get rid of it
    I don't think you absolutely need 0 sse in the leaves, since there're examples working


[ ] The pointcloud makes little sense (lod does really line up with the bounds)
[ ] script to convert pointcloud tileset to implicit tileset?

[ ] Try to traverse the subtree arrays in tree style (is this a waste of time?)
    NOTE: Not sure about storing subtree refs (don't store for now)
    subtree ref / chilren subtree ref

[ ] toroidial subtree viewer? it's camera relative, right?
[ ] incrementally move components to array style
