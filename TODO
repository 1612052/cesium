*** should last row of availability just indicate if it has a child in those spots (to know if 0 sse or not)
and also indicate the external availability as normal but last row can't init tiles like the rest
of the subtree
*** only real reason to do the above is if 0 sse is really important and can't get rid of it
    I don't think you absolutely need 0 sse in the leaves, since there're examples working


[ ] Box array traversal
    [x] Precompute 1D array of influence radii
    [x] need the maxTraversalDepth, derived from root camera distance
    [ ] blow away most of traversal (be careful still need some stuff I think)
    [ ] Toroidial array stack (or whatever), just setup the root level
    and look down at teh tileset, the idx should update properly as if the root box
    was part of a continuous grid.

[ ] script to convert pointcloud tileset to implicit tileset?
[ ] The pointcloud makes little sense (content doesn't line up with the bounds (in the z direction))

[ ] toroidial subtree viewer? it's camera relative, right?
[ ] incrementally move components to array style
