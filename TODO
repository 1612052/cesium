*** should last row of availability just indicate if it has a child in those spots (to know if 0 sse or not)
and also indicate the external availability as normal but last row can't init tiles like the rest
of the subtree
*** only real reason to do the above is if 0 sse is really important and can't get rid of it
    I don't think you absolutely need 0 sse in the leaves, since there're examples working


[ ] External tilesets
   wheres the best spot for external tilesets? it would have to be the leaf tile and not its children
   for uniqueness / single request going out. in fact when you request leaf tiles, also request the subtree
   and make subtree requests higher priority (add a digit)
   so a tile can have a _request and a _requestSubtree

   Make a new Tileset3DTileContent class (put subtree in the name) and updte cesium3dtilecontentfactory
   Call the subt thing instead of the json factory in Cesium3DTileImplicit.prototype.requestContent
   But how to I fetch both the tile and the external subtree?
   Since the processing for external tileset tiles is empty function, could just call both request functions
   the other request function might not require all the machinery.
   maybe for now I just need to duplicate the code path for the external subtree stuff (members and functions)

   // Get rid of ones you don't really need
   _serverKeySubtree
   _contentResourceSubtree
   contentExpiredSubtree // not included
   _requestSubtree
   _contentSubtreeState
   _contentSubtreeState
   _contentSubtreeReadyToProcessPromise
   _contentSubtreeReadyPromise

[ ] Try to traverse the subtree arrays in tree style (is this a waste of time?)
    NOTE: Not sure about storing subtree refs (don't store for now)
    subtree ref / chilren subtree ref

[ ] toroidial subtree viewer? it's camera relative, right?
[ ] cone tracing?
[ ] look at the sse calculation and see if theres a good way to pre-calc the sse spheres and sphere deltas
[ ] incrementally move components to array style
[ ] try to go full bresenham

[ ] 4 para patent brainstorm write ups for traversal(cone trace?), ray trace,
    give me highest lods in this bounds, and whatever else
