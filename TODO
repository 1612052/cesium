Boxes:
If subtree availability is many levels,
break into 2 layers of subtrees(each can have differnt umber of levels)

Need a version that just builds a tree with out all the subtreeinfo stuff, could do dfs or bfs

maybe if not needed save off the relative boxes for subtree so that it can be constructed later
