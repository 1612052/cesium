*** should last row of availability just indicate if it has a child in those spots (to know if 0 sse or not)
and also indicate the external availability as normal but last row can't init tiles like the rest
of the subtree
*** only real reason to do the above is if 0 sse is really important and can't get rid of it

[ ] get old method squared away with cartesian4's everywhere, starting from subtreeRootKey that's passed in

[ ] Try to traverse the subtree arrays in tree style (is this a waste of time?)

    NOTE: Not sure about storing subtree refs (don't store for now)
    subtree ref / chilren subtree ref

[ ] toroidial subtree viewer? it's camera relative, right?
[ ] cone tracing?
[ ] look at the sse calculation and see if theres a good way to pre-calc the sse spheres and sphere deltas
[ ] incrementally move components to array style
[ ] try to go full bresenham

[ ] 4 para patent brainstorm write ups for traversal(cone trace?), ray trace,
    give me highest lods in this bounds, and whatever else
