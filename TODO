*** should last row of availability just indicate if it has a child in those spots (to know if 0 sse or not)
and also indicate the external availability as normal but last row can't init tiles like the rest
of the subtree
*** only real reason to do the above is if 0 sse is really important and can't get rid of it
    I don't think you absolutely need 0 sse in the leaves, since there're examples working


[ ] Box array traversal
    [ ] precompute 1D array of influence radii
    [ ] don't do culling, just take tiles within range for each level (start with root)
    [ ] toroidial array stack (or whatever), just setup the root level
    and look down at teh tileset, the idx should update properly as if the root box
    was part of a continuous grid.

[ ] script to convert pointcloud tileset to implicit tileset?
[ ] The pointcloud makes little sense (content doesn't line up with the bounds (in the z direction))


[ ] toroidial subtree viewer? it's camera relative, right?
[ ] incrementally move components to array style
