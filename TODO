Boxes:
If subtree availability is many levels,
break into 2 layers of subtrees(each can have differnt umber of levels)

For now just take the subtree thing and build a tree, no subtree arrays.

TODO: for multi grid you want to just take all the tilingScheme.roots
and make tiles(hasTilesetContent) for those off the contentless root.

Need a version that just builds a tree with out all the subtreeinfo stuff, could do dfs or bfs

maybe if not needed save off the relative boxes for subtree so that it can be constructed later
