*** should last row of availability just indicate if it has a child in those spots (to know if 0 sse or not)
and also indicate the external availability as normal but last row can't init tiles like the rest
of the subtree
*** only real reason to do the above is if 0 sse is really important and can't get rid of it
    I don't think you absolutely need 0 sse in the leaves, since there're examples working


[ ] External tilesets
   leaf tile holds a subtree resource, makes a request for the subtree when the tile request goes out as well
   THIS IS ASYNC AND WILL BE BAD WHEN DOING JUST ARRAYS SINCE YOU NEED TO MUTEX ALL ACCESS TO THE MAP
   (or push the tile arrays onto a queue(that has to be mutexed) and updte the map at the top of the frame from this queue)
   WITH TREES YOU DON"T SINCE EXTENDING THE TREE IS AN ISOLATED EDIT
   in fact there already seems to be some inconsistant load results with the pointcloud, maybe due to race condition
   also teh pointcloud makes little sense (lod does really line up with the bounds)


   and make subtree requests higher priority (add a digit)
   so a tile can have a _request and a _requestSubtree

   [ ] The subtree might need 2 bits per tile (at least on the last level) to signal an external subtree
   request is needed, otherwise you'll get a bunch of 404 noise in the console
   could specify a maxDepth in the tileset.json and any tile in the last level must have an external tileset
   unless its at the maxdepth

   [] Get rid of subtree member vars in tile that aren't really needed

[ ] Try to traverse the subtree arrays in tree style (is this a waste of time?)
    NOTE: Not sure about storing subtree refs (don't store for now)
    subtree ref / chilren subtree ref

[ ] toroidial subtree viewer? it's camera relative, right?
[ ] cone tracing?
[ ] look at the sse calculation and see if theres a good way to pre-calc the sse spheres and sphere deltas
[ ] incrementally move components to array style
[ ] try to go full bresenham

[ ] 4 para patent brainstorm write ups for traversal(cone trace?), ray trace,
    give me highest lods in this bounds, and whatever else
