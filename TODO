Unpack the compressed bit array into u8 array? i.e. 0x1 or 0x0 at each index?
Probably since the unpacking would be in an inner loop

[ ] Try to traverse the subtree arrays in tree style (is this a waste of time?)
    Tiles store:
    NOTE: Not sure about storing subtree refs (don't store for now)
    *** should last row of availability just indicate if it has a child in those spots (to know if 0 sse or not)
    and also indicate the external availability as normal but last row can't init tiles like the rest
    of the subtree
    *** only real reason to do the above is if 0 sse is really important and can't get rid of it

    subtree ref / chilren subtree ref
    treeKey, subtreeKey, subtreeIndex, subtreeRootKey
    children treeKeys, subtreeKeys, subtreeIndices
    children subtreeRootKey

[ ] toroidial subtree viewer? it's camera relative, right?
[ ] look at the sse calculation and see if theres a good way to pre-calc the sse spheres and sphere deltas
[ ] incrementally move components to array style
[ ] try to go full bresenham
